## 💻 Program Details
The **MotorPH Automatic Payroll System** is a Java application that automates payroll processing. The system reads employee information and attendance records from CSV files and calculates employee salaries based on their recorded working hours.

The program determines the total hours worked by each employee within a selected payroll cutoff period (1–15 or 16–31 of the month). Using the employee’s hourly rate, it calculates the gross salary and automatically applies government deductions such as **SSS, PhilHealth, Pag-IBIG, and withholding tax** to produce the final net salary.

## 🚀 Program Features
- **Employee Login:** Secure login system with username and 5-digit password.
- **Payroll Admin Access:** Dedicated login for processing and reviewing the entire workforce.
- **Scalability:** Handles 100+ employees (expandable up to 1000).
- **Automated CSV Reading:** Dynamically pulls data from `Employee_Data.csv` and `Attendance_Logs.csv`.
- **Deduction Engine:** Accurate computation for SSS, PhilHealth, Pag-IBIG, and Tax.
- **Cutoff Management:** Handles bi-monthly payroll periods (1–15, 16–31).
